Git Class Notes: Resolving Push Error â€“ Remote Contains Work

Scenario:
You ran:

git push -u origin main

Error Output:

To https://github.com/parshv1234/teachersdaychallenge.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/parshv1234/teachersdaychallenge.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

Why This Happens:
This error occurs because the remote 'main' branch has commits that your local 'main' does not. Git blocks your push to prevent overwriting remote changes.

Fix Steps:

1. You tried pulling with rebase:

git pull origin main --rebase

2. Got this error:

error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.
error: please commit or stash them.

3. To fix this, either:

- Commit your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "WIP: save changes before rebase"
git pull origin main --rebase

- Or stash your changes:

git stash
git pull origin main --rebase
git stash pop

4. Finally, push your changes:

git push -u origin main

Optional: Force push (use carefully):

git push -u origin main --force

Warning: This overwrites remote history and can delete others' commits.

Summary commands:

Task                      Command
------------------------  ------------------------------
Check status              git status
Commit changes            git add . && git commit -m "message"
Stash changes             git stash
Pull with rebase          git pull origin main --rebase
Apply stashed changes     git stash pop
Push changes              git push -u origin main

1. Increase Git buffer size (often fixes this):
bash
Copy
Edit
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
This sets the buffer to 500MB.
