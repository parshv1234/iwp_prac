## üìù Project Description

This repository serves as my dedicated workspace and record-keeping for the **Internet & Web Programming (IWP) Practical** course at VIT Bhopal. Under the guidance of our faculty, **Dr. Sajjad Ahmed**, I am completing daily tasks and assignments related to web development.

Currently, this repository contains my progress in **HTML and CSS**, primarily following the learning modules and exercises provided by **W3Schools**. This setup allows me to:

* Track my daily practical submissions.
* Maintain an organized portfolio of my web development learning journey.
* Reinforce concepts through hands-on coding.

## üìÇ Repository Structure (Current & Planned)

This repository will be organized to reflect the progression of topics and daily tasks assigned by Dr. Sajjad Ahmed.

* `html-css/`: Contains all my practical work related to HTML and CSS.
    * `[topic_name]/`: Subfolders for specific HTML/CSS concepts (e.g., `forms`, `tables`, `flexbox`, `grid`).
    * `day-X-task/`: Folders for daily assignments (e.g., `day-01-intro`, `day-02-forms`).
* `javascript/` (Future)
* `[other_web_technologies]/` (Future)

## ‚ú® Current Progress Highlights

As of now, I have completed practical exercises covering foundational HTML and CSS concepts, largely based on W3Schools tutorials. This includes:

* Basic HTML structure and elements
* CSS styling (inline, internal, external)
* Selectors, properties, and values
* Box Model (margins, padding, borders)
* Layout techniques (Flexbox, basic positioning)
* [Add any other specific HTML/CSS topics you've covered, e.g., Forms, Tables, Responsive Design basics]
