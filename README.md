## üìù Project Description

This repository serves as my dedicated workspace and record-keeping for the **Internet & Web Programming (IWP) Practical** course at VIT Bhopal. Under the guidance of our esteemed faculty, **Dr. Sajjad Ahmed**, I am completing daily tasks and assignments related to web development.

Currently, this repository primarily contains my progress in **HTML and CSS**, with exercises largely based on the learning modules and content from **W3Schools**. This setup allows me to:

* Track my daily practical submissions efficiently.
* Maintain an organized portfolio of my web development learning journey.
* Reinforce foundational concepts through hands-on coding.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation through the various practical assignments and associated assets.

* **HTML/CSS Labs (`.html` files directly in root):**
    * `23bce10807_Lab1.html` through `23bce10807_Lab7.html`: These files represent my completed laboratory assignments, likely covering core HTML and CSS concepts.
* **CSS Stylesheets (`.css` files in root):**
    * `mystyle.css`, `mystyle1.css`, `mystyle2.css`: These are external stylesheets used by the various HTML labs for styling.

    * `img_chania.jpg`, `frenchfood.jpg`, `klematis4_big.jpg`, `paper.gif`, `workplace.jpg`, `img_submit.gif`, `img_tree.png`: General image assets used across different labs.
    * `htm/`:
        * `croissant.htm`, `croissant.jpg`: Specific content and asset, possibly related to a particular assignment.
    * `images/`:
        * `img_girl.jpg`: Another dedicated image folder.
* **Screenshots (`ss/`):**
    * `ss/Screenshot*.png`: This folder contains screenshots, likely capturing the output or progress of different labs.
* **Git Notes (`gitnotes/`):**
    * `gitnotes/gitnotes.txt`: Personal notes related to Git usage or commands.
* **Miscellaneous:**
    * `currentdir.py`: A Python script, possibly for utility.
    * `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
